# 📘 react_supersimpledev

Welcome to my personal learning journal for the **SuperSimpleDev React course**! This repository captures my day-to-day journey through modern React fundamentals, featuring concise summaries, hands-on code, and reflections.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- 🌱 Build a solid foundation in React (hooks, JSX, props, state, components)
- 🧠 Apply concepts to real-world mini-projects
- 💡 Document learning clearly, for both review and sharing with others
- 🏁 Maintain daily progress and stay consistent!

---

> 💡 I'm pushing commits after each lesson with a clear naming pattern like `day-03: conditional rendering`.

## 🧠 Reflections

Each lesson includes short notes or challenges in its respective folder or file. I focus on **why** concepts matter, not just what they do — especially useful for interviews!
